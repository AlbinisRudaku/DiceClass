# DiceClass
Problemi që duhet zgjidhur është:
- Write a model class that represents a die ( that is, a cube whose sides are numbered 1 to 6).
The class will likely have just one method, throw(), and no atributes.
( Hint: use Math.random() to write throw. ) Then , write an output-view class that displays after it has been thrown.
Finally, write a controller that lets a user throw two dice repeatedly. -
